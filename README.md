# polish-text-correct-website
A simple auto-correct utility website for the polish language. Created by using pyspellchekcer and by creating my own word frequency dictionary for the Polish Language.

## some examples

The first line is polish with mistakes in the test
The second line is the text corrected by the app

> dziekujr

> dziekuje

Case is preserved after the correction

> Dziekujr

> Dziekuje

Puncuation is preserved as well

> Jaq suę masz?

> Jak się masz?
